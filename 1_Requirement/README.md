# REQUIREMENT


## Introduction 
-Now a days the rate of Continuous usage of ambulance around our city has been increased a lot.
-So to avoid Ambulance to wait in a signal if the signal is in Red sign, we can implement this project around our cities 
to make sure that ambulance or any other emergency vehicels need not wait until the particular signal turns green.

##Features
-The main  feature of this project is to avoid the wait time of an emergency vehical in a traffic signal.
-This helps in saving time which in turn helps in saving lifes. 

## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats

### Strengths
- User Friendly
- Easy to alter the traffic light to turn green if it is red.
- Modular Approach
- Low cost and very efficient.

### Weakness
- This may take lot of time to be implemented to all the traffic poles around the city. 

### Opportunities
- It can be implemented by Using basic microcontollers and sensors.
- The cost will not be two high 

### Threats 
- Time taken to implement this project will be high 
- The requirement of Man power to implement this project will be high.\

## 4W's and 1'H
### **WHAT** : Automatic Traffic Light System for Emergency Vehical
### **WHERE** : Used in Automotive Industries
### **WHEN** : At Very Emergency situations
### **Who** : By an Embedded Engineer 

### **How** : using SimulIDE and Embedded C

## components

  #### Sensors 
  * A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.
  * The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or any one of a great number of other environmental phenomena
  * The output is generally a signal that is converted to human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing. 

  #### Actuators
  * An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system, for example by opening a valve.
  * In simple terms, it is a "mover".
  * An actuator requires a control signal and a source of energy.
