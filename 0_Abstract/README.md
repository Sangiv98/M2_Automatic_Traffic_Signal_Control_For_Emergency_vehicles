#Automatic Traffic Signal Control For Emergency vehicals

 1) In modern era, increase in traffic in the city makes emergency vehicles,
    like ambulance, to take more time to reach the destination. 
 2) The current, time-based traffic management system is not suitable and also not flexible for present day traffic, 
    especially at the intersection where the traffic needs to be controlled for vehicles from all four directions. 
 3) To solve this problem, we bring users a sound detector with automatic recording of various vehicle sounds and distinguishing the presence of ambulance in a particular
    lane by detecting the siren sound.
 4) The captured ambulance sound is processed using IOT and sent to the traffic pole to enhance the traffic clearance. 
 5) This is carried out by placing the sensors in each lane and a sensor near the traffic pole to indicate that the ambulance has crossed the lane. 
 6) In this method the traffic signal controller decides when the vehicle has to cross the road and also provide importance to the emergency vehicle.


#Applications of Arduino UNO
 The Arduino boards can work as a stand-alone project and can be interfaced with other Arduino
 boards or Raspberry Pi boards. Arduino UNO board is used in the following
 applications.
 
 •	WeighingMachines

 •	Traffic Light Count Down Timer

 •	Parking LotCounter

 •	Embeddedsystems

 •	HomeAutomation

 •	IndustrialAutomation

 •	MedicalInstrument

 •	Emergency Light forRailways


#Applications of LCD:

 • Clocks: Used in displays in digital wallclocks

 • Cameras: Used in digital cameras for displayingimages

 • Television: Has a major application in LCD TFTscreens

 • Computer monitors: Most of the modern world computer monitors are made of LCDs

 • Instrument panels: All the lab instruments uses LCD screens fordisplay

 • Aircraft cockpit displays: Cockpit display panels of pilots are usuallyLCDs

 • Video players: Such screens are very popular in video game parlors andconsoles

 • Watches: All the digital wrist watches uses LCD screen for displayingtime

 • Calculators: Calculator display screens are LCDscreens
